# Jira Workflow Demo

This repository demonstrates my understanding of Jira workflows and Bitbucket/Git integration concepts.

## Key Concepts
- Linking Jira issues with Git branches
- Git workflow: feature branch -> commit -> pull request -> merge
- Issue lifecycle: To Do -> In Progress -> In Review -> Done
- Simple automation rules in Jira

## Tools
- Jira Software (demo project)
- Confluence (documentation)
- Bitbucket (workflow concepts)
- Git / GitHub (repository hosting)
