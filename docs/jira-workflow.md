# Jira Workflow Demo

## Sample Workflow
1. Create a Jira issue: GSLY-1 (Task / Story / Bug)
2. Create a feature branch: feature/GSLY-1-login
3. Commit changes with issue key: git commit -m "GSLY-1: add login page"
4. Push branch and open Pull Request in Bitbucket/GitHub
5. Move Jira issue to "In Review" → then "Done" after merge
